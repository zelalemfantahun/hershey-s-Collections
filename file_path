Sure, I am suicidal sometimes, but yesterday wasn't one of them. The whole thing occurred because of the first two paragraphs of my previous blog entry, which reads:

&gt; was planning to do on the final day of updates, Thursday. (You could probably
&gt; guess if you know me enough.)

&gt; I spent &gt;$150, money that was supposed to pay bills. I'm still glad I did that. 
&gt; It feels so good to say "Fuck you, bills", even though I know it's gonna be a 
&gt; problem later.
